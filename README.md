We are going to replace our local state management from redux to the new context API. This repository is our application before we introduced sagas to handle our asynchronous code, which is a good starting point to make the appropriate changes!

Remember to replace the config variable in your firebase.utils.js with your own config object from the firebase dashboard! Navigate to the project settings and scroll down to the config code. Copy the object in the code and replace the variable in your cloned code.
